# 🧠 image-matching-on-trained-reference

Compare images against a precomputed reference set using deep features (ResNet18).  
All operations are offline and require no GPU.

## 📝 Tagline
> Efficient, offline image similarity detection using a trained reference dataset.

---

## 📌 Short Description
This tool scans new images and compares them against a trained set of reference images using ResNet18 feature vectors.  
If the similarity score exceeds a threshold, the image is marked as a match.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

This tool was developed to identify scanned images containing postal envelopes based on their overall visual appearance (e.g. shape, contrast, layout, quantity).  
It compares new images against a trained reference set to detect visual similarity, not exact duplication.

Typical applications:
- Detecting images that share a common layout or structure
- Flagging images that likely contain known object types (e.g. envelopes)
- Pre-sorting or tagging scanned materials by visual pattern

## 🔧 Features
- Offline operation (no cloud, no network needed)
- Uses pretrained ResNet18 for feature extraction
- Compares new images recursively from folders
- Automatically renames matched files
- Configurable similarity threshold

## 🧪 Usage

1. Put reference images into the `images/` folder.
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python traning.py
   ```
3. Put new images (including subfolders) into `zu_pruefen/`.
4. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn numpy pillow
```

Dependencies are also listed in `requirements.txt`.

## 🧠 Internals

- Feature vectors are 512-dimensional, generated by ResNet18 (feature part only).
- Cosine similarity is used to compare vectors.
- Matching threshold is configurable (default: 0.89).
- Identified matches are renamed to `Match_<originalname>.jpg`.

---

## 📌 Notes

- All operations are performed offline.
- Designed for image sets with high visual consistency.
- ResNet18 weights are loaded locally via torchvision.
